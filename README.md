# Displayer

This is a React Video Chat and Screen Share App that connects with Twilio Programable Video API. 


## Start

`npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or webpack separately, you can also `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.

From there, just follow your bliss.
